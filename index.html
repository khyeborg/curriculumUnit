				<p>Welcome to the curriculum overview of Understanding the Pandemic!</p>

				<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has completely altered our definition of daily normalcy. In addition to changing the way we socially interact, it has changed the way we engaged with academics in ways we never could have predicted. As the overall percentage of people infected and dying nationwide remains fairly low, the percentage of people infected and dying in black and brown communities have been disproportionately higher than other communities. This curriculum was created to give students power over their learning and the tools to connect what they are doing in the classroom with what is going on in the world around them. Through the use of exponential functions and computer science technologies, students are going to study how the pandemic is spreading through their communities. Through the data collected and modeled, students will be able to analyze various scenarios of how the pandemic spread is affecting their communities as well as the socioemotional impact it has had on their lives and the lives of people around them.</p>

				<p>"Curriculum needs to be organized around knowledge that relates to the communities, cultures and traditions that gives students a history, identity and place." - Giroux</p> 

				<p>Giroux makes a fair acknowledgment of relating curriculum to the student. These times we are living in is perfect to bring these concepts to life. Right now we are living in a moment in history that the students can become a part of. This curriculum encourages pedagogical practices that can be used to give students a voice during the pandemic. Culturally responsive and relevant pedagogy within this curriculum brings into the academics the nature of this global pandemic. It connects the study of the data driven decisions we have been making for the last 9 months to the common emotions felt throughout all cultures and homes around the world. New traditions have arisen because of our new social interaction requirements. This curriculum allows for students to explore the question of what comes next.</p> 

				<p>“The term culturally sustaining requires that our pedagogies be more than responsive of or relevant to the cultural experiences and practices of young people — it requires that they support young people in sustaining the cultural and linguistic competence of their communities while simultaneously offering access to dominant cultural competence.” - Django Paris</p>

				<p>Similar to the notions expressed in Paris’ opinions on culturally sustaining pedagogy, the tasks found in this curriculum connects the fact that the pandemic can be seen as just a relevant topic of study to the toolbox of skills and concepts mastered for a lifelong journey of study long after the pandemic is over. Although students will be exposed to this curriculum for a small period of time, the objectives mastered within this time are transferable to the many other aspects of their lives. With the skills mastered within the exponential function unit, the students can create equations/formulas and study anything that affects their communities. With the skills mastered in the computer science unit students can model various types of data, draw conclusions, and make predictions with any topic that pique curiosity within their own lives. Strategically this curriculum allows for students to build techniques used to analyze data by having students study the pandemic and everything that is encompassed within the spread of COVID 19 through their communities. Empowering each student to become the person that can create change by having people around them and in their communities better understand this virus based on their own findings.</p>

				<h1 class="title">Social Relevance</h1>
				<p>Why is this work important? The point of education is to prepare students for the real world by exposing the students to curriculum that can be utilized within their lives. Students should be able to take academics and apply the skills and concepts learned to solve real world problems, analyze real world scenarios,  draw conclusions about scenarios in real life, and make predictions about what will come next. 

				<p>This global pandemic has forced us to reimagine and reshape education for the millions of students all over the world. We had no choice but to extend our learning experiences from in person instruction to completely remote in the matter of days. This forced educators to think of best practices for a lot of the pedagogy we so innately mastered the delivery for face to face.  Now that administrators have a bigger agenda for engaging students in online learning platforms that are hands-on, here is a curriculum that spreads across multiple engaging virtual platforms. These platforms can be used to push the students rigorously to study the data about the world around them.</p> 

				<p>In the unit where the students are mastering exponential function the students are asked to create exponential equations that can be used to model various scenarios such as appreciation and depreciation of items. The connection between different types of exponential growth functions come into play when students are then asked to study the spread of COVID-19 within their communities based on parameters created with live data. The students can then use this to make predictions about where they would rather live by studying the spread of COVID-19 in another city of choice. In the unit where students are mastering computer science skills students are creating different parameters for a generator that will visually create the spread of the COVID pandemic. Using these visualizations students can see how fast the spread of COVID-19 can happen within a community of people. This pandemic is here and extremely present in the lives of our students and their families. Through this curriculum, the students will gain the knowledge needed to study the spread of COVID-19 in their communities as well as creating the space to reflect on their socioemotional state in the current moment.</p>

				<h1 class="title">Goals</h1>
				<p>The biggest goal of this curriculum is to create a student-led experience that breaks through the barrier of academics being done in the classroom only. Through these learning experiences the goal is that students are engaged, empowered, taking charge of their own learning, and to be in good spirits while doing all of the above. Academically, students are to meet the common core math standards and math practices set by New York State for exponential functions which include being able to analyze and model with exponential equations. Students are also able to use computer science simulations and visualizations to learn about the pandemic.</p>

				<h2 class="computer_science_h2">Introduction</h2>
				<p class="computer_science_p">Welcome to the Computer Science section of the “Understanding the Pandemic” curriculum! In the Computer Science section, students will engage in hands-on coding projects using the p5 Coding Library to build simulations to visualize the spread of COVID-19. The Computer Science section of the curriculum aims to instill awareness about the mechanics of the spread of COVID-19 using culturally sustaining pedagogy and authentic assessments. Through the simulations and coding projects, students will better understand the underlying mechanics of COVID-19 from an analytical perspective to better protect themselves, each other, and their families.</p>

				<h2 class="computer_science_h2">Culturally Sustaining Pedagogy</h2>
				<p class="computer_science_p">In the Day 7: Virus Variables Input section, students will make use of the COVID Alert NY app and other reliable COVID-19 data sources to gain accurate data to run disease spread simulations that reflect the difference in spread in neighborhoods of different demographics, especially contrasting the difference in spread, recovery, and mortality rates between predominantly white neighborhoods and minority neighborhoods. Students are asked to collect data of the demographics distribution in different cities, select a predominantly white neighborhood and a minority neighborhood, and collect COVID-19 data in the cities selected. Students will use the data collected to run two simulations and record their observations to be used in further discussions centered on reasons for the difference in spread and mortality.</p>

				<h2 class="computer_science_h2">Authentic Assessment</h2>
				<p class="computer_science_p">In the assessment section, students will use the existing code as the foundation and implement additional features to enhance the COVID-19 simulation to better reflect the real time spread of COVID-19. Students are introduced to the assessment and guided to formulate additional features to be added to the existing simulation to better reflect the real time spread of COVID-19. Students are encouraged to tackle the assessment from any aspects of the virus, based on their field of interests. Two sample projects with downloadable source code can be found to introduce students to some possible ways of enhancing the simulation.</p>
